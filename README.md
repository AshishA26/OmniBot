# OmniBot
A remote-controlled robot that has the ability to move in more directions than usually possible using unique mecanum wheels. 
Controlled using custom-designed Joystick and nRF24L01 module.
Programmed in `Platform IO`, models created in `Solidworks`, schematics created in `KiCad`.

## Instructions
- Upload the OmniBot-Joystick.ino in the `src/OmniBot-Joystick` folder to the joystick
- The entire `Platform IO` project is to be uploaded to the OmniBot
- More coming soon

## Note
The OmniBot-Joystick is a slightly modified version of my [RC-Joystick](https://github.com/AshishA26/RC-Joystick).
